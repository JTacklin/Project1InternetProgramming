    <h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello my name is Justin Tackling. I am a student in Information Technology. I am a student athlete at UNF and am a avid member
      of many organizations/clubs here at UNF including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming">NCompetitive Programming</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wikicu.com/Student-Athlete_Advisory_Committee">SAAC</a> (Student Athlete Advisory Committee). As SAAC chair I travel the US going
     to meeting and meeting with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association">NCAA</a> chairs and athletes to see what can be impoved upon in NCAA athletics</p>
      
      <p>It might be hard to belive but i was once a nursing major. It took me awhile to find what I enjoy and how I want to spend my time here. I thankfully landed on
        information Technology and I love what I do. As of now I am o course to graduate in Spring of 2024. I'm not to certain if I should go for my masters or not
      but I've made it my goal to keep as many doors open for myself as possible</p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>My main hobby is my sport,track. Most of my time is spent doing this as every week I'm somewhere else in the country competeing at a cross country,indoor/outdoor track
       Outside of track and cross country I really enjoy playing cards with my friends and practicing on my soft skill with websites like Leetcode and Kattis.</p>

    <p>Outside of my degree of Information Technology, I have a minor in buisiness and I enjoy exploring entrepreneurial opportunities and learning how to start a buisiness. I go to many of the conferences held for 
      the students (usually at Herburt hall) and enjpy connecting and meeting with people there.
    </p>
    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
    <p>
      From the start of my educational career I've wanted to set lofty goals for myself. I am the first in my family to go to college so I want to represent myself and my family well. I hope to persue my masters in IT
      and continue my eduaction while also being a great member of the UNF community, both academically and athleticly.

    </p>
